# Cadence Tutorials Style Guide

Welcome to the Cadence Tutorials style guide! This document provides guidelines to help contributors maintain a consistent look and feel across the tutorial website. Please follow these recommendations when updating or adding content.

## General Principles

- **Clarity:** Write in simple, clear language. Avoid jargon unless necessary, and explain technical terms.
- **Consistency:** Use consistent formatting, terminology, and structure throughout all tutorials.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure content is readable and accessible to all users.

## Markdown Formatting

- Use `#` for main titles, `##` for section headings, and `###` for subheadings.
- Separate sections with blank lines for readability.
- Use bullet points (`-` or `*`) for lists.
- Use numbered lists for step-by-step instructions.
- Use backticks `` ` `` for inline code and triple backticks for code blocks.
- Always specify the language for code blocks, e.g.,  
    ````markdown
    ```cadence
    // Cadence code here
    ```
    ````

## Code Examples

- Indent code blocks consistently.
- Add comments to explain non-obvious code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Avoid overly complex examples; keep them focused on the topic.

## Links and References

- Use descriptive link text, e.g., `[Cadence Documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/)`.
- Reference official documentation when possible.

## Images and Diagrams

- Use images sparingly and only when they add value.
- Include alt text for accessibility, e.g.,  
    `![Transaction Flow Diagram](images/transaction-flow.png)`

## Tone and Voice

- Use a friendly, encouraging tone.
- Address the reader directly ("you").
- Avoid slang and overly casual language.

## File Naming and Structure

- Use lowercase and hyphens for file names, e.g., `getting-started.md`.
- Organize tutorials into logical folders.

## Reviewing and Updating

- Proofread for spelling and grammar.
- Test code examples before publishing.
- Keep tutorials up to date with the latest Cadence features.
